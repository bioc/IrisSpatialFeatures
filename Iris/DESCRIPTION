Description: Iris reads the output of the PerkinElmer inForm software and calculates a variety of spatial statistics. In addition to simple counts, it can derive average nearest neighbors for each cell-type and interaction summary profiles for each celltype. These statistics are derived across images, both overall and regions of interest as defined by user defined masks.
