#' IrisSpatialFeatures: A package to extract spatial features based on multiplex IF images
#'
#' Iris reads the output of the PerkinElmer inForm software and calculates 
#' a variety of spatial statistics. In addition to simple counts, it can 
#' derive average nearest neighbors for each cell-type and interaction 
#' summary profiles for each celltype. These statistics are derived across 
#' images, both overall and regions of interest as defined by user defined 
#' masks.
